# Batch 71: Homework for July 26
**Note:** homework assignments are not graded, but it is strongly encouraged to complete them in order build understanding between sessions and keep up with the pace of the course. It is recommended to spend ~30 min. per day engaging with the homework material.

## Readings
* *Get Programming with Haskell*: **Lessons 1 - 5** (p. 1 - 53) https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-haskell

## Video
* "Computerphile: Curried Functions" - Graham Hutton https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psmu_VAuiag

## Code
* After reading **Lesson 3: Lambda Functions and Lexical Scope**...
  * Review the code in `Scope.hs`
  * Answer the questions and test your answers in GHCI
* After reading **Lesson 4: First-Class Functions**, review the code in `FCF.hs`
* After reading **Lesson 5: Closures and Partial Application**...
  * Review the code in `Currying.js`
    * This file shows how to curry and partially-apply functions in JavaScript. It is offered for comparison with Haskell, to demonstrate the convenience Haskell provides by currying all functions by default.
    * If you are familiar with JavaScript (or similar languages), this may make currying and partial application easier to understand. If you aren't familiar with JavaScript, just try your best to understand what the code is doing, but don't spend too much time on it.
  * Review the code in `PA.hs`

## Miro Board:
* **Haskell Intro Miro Board:** https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO8CQ3sc=/?share_link_id=903882101745
